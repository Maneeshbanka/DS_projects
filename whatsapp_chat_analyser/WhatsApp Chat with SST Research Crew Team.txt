02/02/2023, 11:40 - Amruthvarsh Sst: Good morning everyone!! 

My event idea :- AstraX'23

In these event we divide into 4 parts :-
1.Astrophotography( shooting  star)
2.Estrella(Blog writing) 
3.Mission X (case study)
4.Gordian knot (Astro quiz) 

These are some of the themes.
 • The blog writing is related to the participants need to write the blogs related to space. 
•  In Mission X they need to make a research on more some topics related to space and they need to bring out some case study. 
• Gordian knot a quiz on space Concepts .

We can change the themes if we found somemore interesting.

Thank you ||
